**Podcast Name:** Dead Air  
**Tagline:** "Cold Cases. Hot Takes. No Silence."

## Design Prompt

```
Modern minimalist true crime podcast logo for "DEAD AIR"

Visual Elements:
- Sound wave or audio waveform that flatlines/goes silent in the middle 
  (representing "dead air" in broadcasting + death)
- Subtle integration of a microphone silhouette or headphone shape
- Optional: faint evidence markers (like crime scene number tags) 
  or case file folder edge worked into the design
- Clean sans-serif typography with intentional negative space

Color Palette:
- Primary: Deep charcoal black (#1a1a1a)
- Accent: Blood red (#8B0000) or forensic blue (#2E4A62)
- Secondary: Cold steel gray (#4A4A4A)
- Highlight: Evidence yellow (#FFD700) for subtle accents

Style Direction:
- Neo-noir aesthetic meets modern podcast branding
- Sophisticated, not sensationalized
- Evokes mystery and investigation without being macabre
- Should work at small sizes (podcast thumbnails) and large (merchandise)
- Flat design with potential for subtle gradients

Typography:
- "DEAD" in bold condensed weight
- "AIR" in lighter weight or with letterpress/knockout effect
- Consider the "A" in AIR as a subtle play (microphone stand, 
  evidence marker, or sound wave peak)

Mood:
- Professional investigative journalism
- Quiet intensity (the silence before revelation)
- Cerebral, analytical, respectful of victims
- Modern true crime, not horror or gore

Avoid:
- Skull imagery, blood splatter, crime tape clichés
- Overly dark/horror aesthetic
- Busy or cluttered design
- Generic podcast microphone icons

Format Deliverables:
- Square format (1:1) for podcast platforms
- Horizontal lockup for YouTube/website header
- Monochrome version for merchandise
- Favicon/app icon simplified version
```

## Alternative Concept Directions

### Direction A: "The Flatline"
Sound waveform that peaks then goes flat, spelling out "DEAD AIR" in the wave pattern itself.

### Direction B: "The Case File"
Minimalist manila folder tab with "DEAD AIR" stamped in official-looking type, slight wear/aged effect.

### Direction C: "The Signal"
Radio tower or broadcast antenna emitting concentric waves that fade to nothing, integrated with typography.

### Direction D: "The Silence"
Negative space design where the absence of sound (white/empty space) forms a key visual element within solid letterforms.
