## Dialogue Dynamics

### The Debate Format

Our hosts don't just narrate—they *discuss*. Every episode features genuine intellectual tension.

**Pattern: Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis**

```
MAYA: [excited] I think the husband did it. The timeline, the motive, 
      the insurance policy—it all points to him.

DR. THORNE: [scoffs] The timeline is circumstantial at best. And the 
            insurance policy? Standard coverage. Nothing unusual.

MAYA: But the neighbor saw his car—

DR. THORNE: [interrupting] The neighbor saw *a* car. A dark sedan. 
            You know how many dark sedans were registered in that 
            county in 1994?

MAYA: Okay, fine. But what about the phone records?

DR. THORNE: [dramatic_pause] Now *that's* interesting. The phone 
            records are where this case gets complicated.
```

### Reaction Beats

Maya's reactions drive emotional engagement:

| Reaction | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| "Wait, what?" | Surprising evidence | "Wait, what? He was at the scene *twice*?" |
| "No way." | Disbelief | "No way. The detective missed that?" |
| "Full. Body. Chills." | Major revelation | "Full. Body. Chills. That's the smoking gun." |
| "I knew it!" | Theory confirmation | "I knew it! I called it from the beginning." |
| "That's so sad." | Victim moments | "That's so sad. She was just trying to help." |

### Aris's Corrections

Aris keeps the narrative grounded:

| Correction Type | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| Factual | "Actually, the autopsy showed blunt force trauma, not strangulation." |
| Logical | "That assumes the killer had access to the house. We haven't established that." |
| Procedural | "The police couldn't pursue that lead—chain of custody was compromised." |
| Statistical | "Statistically, 85% of female homicide victims knew their killer." |

---

## Tone Guidelines

### The Atmosphere

**Think:** Late-night conversation between two obsessed friends who happen to be experts.

**NOT:** News broadcast, lecture, or shock-jock entertainment.

### Balancing Act

| Element | Too Little | Just Right | Too Much |
|---------|------------|------------|----------|
| Humor | Grim, exhausting | Tension relief | Disrespectful |
| Detail | Vague, unsatisfying | Immersive | Gratuitous |
| Emotion | Cold, clinical | Empathetic | Exploitative |
| Speculation | Boring | Engaging | Irresponsible |

### Language Choices

**DO USE:**
- "The victim" (humanizing)
- "The evidence suggests..."
- "According to court records..."
- "Investigators believe..."
- "The family has stated..."

**AVOID:**
- "The body" (dehumanizing)
- "Obviously..." (presumptuous)
- "Everyone knows..." (unverified)
- Graphic violence descriptions
- Victim-blaming language

### Examples by Type

**The Twist:**

- "The alibi was perfect. Too perfect."

- "The detective quit the force after this case. Why?"

**The Reveal:**
- "Thirty years cold. One phone call changed everything."
- "The killer left a signature. It took decades to decode."
- "DNA doesn't lie. But it can be planted."

**The Emotional:**
- "Her last words were 'I forgive you.'"
- "He spent 22 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit."
- "The family never stopped searching. Neither did we."

### Platform-Specific Formatting

**TikTok/Reels (15-60 sec):**
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- Visual text overlay
- Cliffhanger ending

**Twitter/X:**

## Content Ethics

### Victim-First Approach

1. **Always humanize** - Share who they were, not just how they died
2. **Family consent** - Reach out before covering recent cases
3. **No graphic details** - Imply violence, don't describe it
4. **Correct the record** - Update if new information emerges

### Suspect Coverage

1. **Innocent until proven guilty** - Use "alleged" appropriately
2. **No armchair diagnosis** - Leave psychology to experts
3. **Avoid demonization** - Even convicted criminals were once human
4. **Platform responsibility** - Don't enable harassment

### Sensitive Topics

| Topic | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Sexual assault | Reference without detail, focus on investigation |
| Child victims | Extra care with family privacy |
| Suicide | Follow media guidelines, include resources |
| Ongoing cases | Clearly label speculation |

## Audio Production Notes

### Pacing Guidelines

```
Scene-setting     → Slow, atmospheric
Evidence reveal   → Building, then pause
Host debate       → Natural conversation pace
Emotional moments → Allow silence
Cliffhangers      → Quick cut to music
```

### Music Cues

| Moment | Music Style |
|--------|-------------|
| Cold open | Ambient, tension-building |
| Theme | Distinctive, memorable hook |
| Transitions | Brief stings, 2-3 seconds |
| Revelations | Subtle sting, then silence |
| Emotional | Minimal, piano or strings |
| Outro | Theme reprise, fade |

### Sound Design

- **Ambient sounds** for scene-setting (rain, traffic, clock ticking)
- **Archival audio** when available and appropriate
- **Silence** is a tool—use it for impact
