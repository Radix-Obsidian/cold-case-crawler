      "summary": "Evan, circa 2017 Evan and his mother,Susan Osborne, were last seen in Holtville, Alabama on May 29, 2017. They lived on Waterview Lane near Highway 111 with her second husband of four years, Jerry Marshall Osborne. They have never been heard from again.\u00a0Susan's family lived out of state and, after two months without being able to contact the pair, they reported them missing on July 29. She had never gone more than a day or two before with calling or texting them.Susan's two cherished dogs were later found at an animal shelter; they'd been dropped off on June 12. Both her and Evan's belongings are missing from the home, but Susan left behind her daughter behind, and her family doesn't think she would have voluntarily abandoned her.When the police went to the house to investigate the disappearances, Jerry told them that on May 29, Susan had decided to leave him and a man had picked her up. The next day, he said, the man returned to the house and removed furniture and other belongings. Susan's car was left behind, however.Shortly before she and her son disappeared, Susan found out Jerry had previously worked at a gay escort before their marriage, advertising his services online. She recognized him in the ad photos by the tattoos. She told her best friend about it by email, asking her not to mention it in texts because Jerry had started reading those. She said she thought Jerry was still escorting and spoke about leaving him, but later said she and Jerry had worked things out and she still loved him.Although Jerry had completely remodeled the house after his wife and stepson disappeared, repainting the walls and replacing the hardwood floors with carpet, authorities later found approximately twenty possible bloodstains in their home, which were sent away for DNA testing. Jerry said he had to repaint because Susan spray-painted vulgar phrases on the walls before she left.Neighbors reported that in the summer of 2017, Jerry burned multiple items of furniture on his property. The house had an elaborate security system with cameras at every door, but by the time the police began investigating, all the footage from the time of Susan and Evan's disappearance was gone because Jerry had bought a replacement system on June 1.Since Susan went missing there hasn't been any activity on her credit cards, phone or social media accounts. Her best friend said Susan had never said anything about seeing another man, and she appeared to have changed her mind about leaving Jerry. Evan's prescriptions have not been refilled since his disappearance, and he missed an oral surgery appointment scheduled for a few days later. He was supposed to start his sophomore year at\u00a0Holtville High School in the fall, and the school hasn't gotten any requests from other schools for his transcripts.Jerry is considered a person of interest in his wife and stepson's disappearances, but he maintains his innocence. The two cases remain unsolved and foul play is suspected. Updated 2 times since October 12, 2004. Last updated April 2, 2021; two pictures added.",

        "circumstances": "Evan, circa 2017 Evan and his mother,Susan Osborne, were last seen in Holtville, Alabama on May 29, 2017. They lived on Waterview Lane near Highway 111 with her second husband of four years, Jerry Marshall Osborne. They have never been heard from again.\u00a0Susan's family lived out of state and, after two months without being able to contact the pair, they reported them missing on July 29. She had never gone more than a day or two before with calling or texting them.Susan's two cherished dogs were later found at an animal shelter; they'd been dropped off on June 12. Both her and Evan's belongings are missing from the home, but Susan left behind her daughter behind, and her family doesn't think she would have voluntarily abandoned her.When the police went to the house to investigate the disappearances, Jerry told them that on May 29, Susan had decided to leave him and a man had picked her up. The next day, he said, the man returned to the house and removed furniture and other belongings. Susan's car was left behind, however.Shortly before she and her son disappeared, Susan found out Jerry had previously worked at a gay escort before their marriage, advertising his services online. She recognized him in the ad photos by the tattoos. She told her best friend about it by email, asking her not to mention it in texts because Jerry had started reading those. She said she thought Jerry was still escorting and spoke about leaving him, but later said she and Jerry had worked things out and she still loved him.Although Jerry had completely remodeled the house after his wife and stepson disappeared, repainting the walls and replacing the hardwood floors with carpet, authorities later found approximately twenty possible bloodstains in their home, which were sent away for DNA testing. Jerry said he had to repaint because Susan spray-painted vulgar phrases on the walls before she left.Neighbors reported that in the summer of 2017, Jerry burned multiple items of furniture on his property. The house had an elaborate security system with cameras at every door, but by the time the police began investigating, all the footage from the time of Susan and Evan's disappearance was gone because Jerry had bought a replacement system on June 1.Since Susan went missing there hasn't been any activity on her credit cards, phone or social media accounts. Her best friend said Susan had never said anything about seeing another man, and she appeared to have changed her mind about leaving Jerry. Evan's prescriptions have not been refilled since his disappearance, and he missed an oral surgery appointment scheduled for a few days later. He was supposed to start his sophomore year at\u00a0Holtville High School in the fall, and the school hasn't gotten any requests from other schools for his transcripts.Jerry is considered a person of interest in his wife and stepson's disappearances, but he maintains his innocence. The two cases remain unsolved and foul play is suspected. Updated 2 times since October 12, 2004. Last updated April 2, 2021; two pictures added."

He borrowed his girlfriend's car and went out drinking with his girlfriend and some friends. He told them he was going to meet someone and would come back later.Barnett was supposed to meet a female friend at a party, but never arrived, and he never returned to the apartment he shared with his girlfriend. His friends tried to call him all night on his cellular phone, but he never picked up. He has never been heard from again. Several days later, Barnett's friends found his girlfriend's car abandoned in the Lakeview area. They had previously searched that location and the car hadn't been there before.In July 2015, Tricia Faye Abney was charged with capital murder in Barnett's case. A photo of Abney is posted with this case summary. She was an exotic dancer in 1995 and worked at an establishment called Sammy's. Authorities believe she lured Barnett to an apartment in the 7700 block of Sunrise Lane, off Oporto-Madrid Boulevard, so she and her then-boyfriend, Jeff Martin, could rob him. The robbery supposedly went bad and the pair stabbed Barnett to death and dismembered his body in the bathtub and buried the remains in Bibb County.Abney and Martin separated after the murder and he eventually married. Abney was arrested multiple times after Barnett's disappearance and convicted of three felony drug charges.The police learned of the crime when Abney's brother came to them in January 2015. He had lived with Abney and Martin at the time of Barnett's disappearance, and he told police he had stumbled across the crime scene after the murder took place and helped his sister and her boyfriend dispose of Barnett's body. He said he came forward because he couldn't bear to keep the secret anymore.Martin took his own life in Mobile, Alabama on the same day Abney was arrested. In Abney's statement to police, she admitted Barnett was killed in her apartment and admitted to playing a role in his murder, although she placed most of the blame on Martin. She was convicted of felony murder at her trial in September 2017 and sentenced to life in prison without parole.According to Abney's brother, he, his sister and Martin took Barnett's dismembered remains to a wooded area in the area of on Southside-Clairmont and 29th Street south, and Abney's brother stayed at the car while Abney and Martin took the remains into the woods.

When she returned the next morning, McFry was gone.The lights and television set in the trailer were turned on and McFry's wallet was left behind. He has never been heard from again.

Inside the vehicle was a blanket which contained hair and tissue and possible bullet fragments and bloodstains.In 1991, David Ronald Chandler was convicted of drug trafficking and ordering McFry's death. He was also convicted of having a role in several other killings, including the death ofJames \"Patrick\" Burrows, who disappeared less than two weeks before McFry.Chandler was a marijuana dealer and Burrows and McFry were also involved in the drug trade; investigators theorized that Chandler had the two men murdered because he believed they had stolen marijuana from him.

Susan's family lived out of state and, after two months without being able to contact the pair, they reported them missing on July 29. She had never gone more than a day or two before with calling or texting them.Susan's two cherished dogs were later found at an animal shelter; they'd been dropped off on June 12. Both her and Evan's belongings are missing from the home, but Susan left behind her daughter behind, and her family doesn't think she would have voluntarily abandoned her.When the police went to the house to investigate the disappearances, Jerry told them that on May 29, Susan had decided to leave him and a man had picked her up. The next day, he said, the man returned to the house and removed furniture and other belongings. Susan's car was left behind, however.Shortly before she and her son disappeared, Susan found out Jerry had previously worked at a gay escort before their marriage, advertising his services online. She recognized him in the ad photos by the tattoos. She told her best friend about it by email, asking her not to mention it in texts because Jerry had started reading those. She said she thought Jerry was still escorting and spoke about leaving him, but later said she and Jerry had worked things out and she still loved him.Although Jerry had completely remodeled the house after his wife and stepson disappeared, repainting the walls and replacing the hardwood floors with carpet, authorities later found approximately twenty possible bloodstains in their home, which were sent away for DNA testing. Jerry said he had to repaint because Susan spray-painted vulgar phrases on the walls before she left.Neighbors reported that in the summer of 2017, Jerry burned multiple items of furniture on his property. The house had an elaborate security system with cameras at every door, but by the time the police began investigating, all the footage from the time of Susan and Evan's disappearance was gone because Jerry had bought a replacement system on June 1.Since Susan went missing there hasn't been any activity on her credit cards, phone or social media accounts. Her best friend said Susan had never said anything about seeing another man, and she appeared to have changed her mind about leaving Jerry. Evan's prescriptions have not been refilled since his disappearance, and he missed an oral surgery appointment scheduled for a few days later.

A photo of Jeffrey is posted with this case summary.In September 2015, Jeffrey's partial skeletal remains were found by a creek bed in a remote, wooded area north of Lee Road 241 near Salem, Alabama, about twenty miles from Phenix City. The remains weren't identified until June 2017. He was 35 when he died, and the cause of death was a gunshot wound.After Jeffrey's murder was discovered, Kristi's family reported her missing.

      "summary": "Carla, circa 1980; Age-progression to age 55 (circa 2020) Carla was last seen at her family's residence at the Eastwood public housing project on Airport Highway in Birmingham, Alabama during the evening hours of August 12, 1980. She and her mother were watching television, and then her mother went to bed.Her mother awoke at approximately 4:30 a.m. on August 13 and discovered the doors to their apartment were wide open. Chairs had been pushed back from the living room table and a soft drink bottle had been overturned as well.Carla's new sandals were near the couch where she had placed them the night before, and her belt was lying on the ground outside the front door. All of her belongings, including money and her medication, had been left behind. There was no sign of her inside the residence. She has never been seen again.Carla had been allegedly abducted and raped by a group of men in July 1980, one month prior to the time she was last seen. The three-hour attack had taken place near Lake Purdy in Alabama. The men had arrived at Carla's family's residence the week before she disappeared, but they were not permitted inside.It is not known if the previous attack is related to Carla's disappearance. No official report about the incident was filed at the time and the police didn't learn about it until eighteen years after Carla went missing. Authorities have continued to search for Carla since 1980.Throughout the years, her mother has been the victim of many individuals attempting to cash in on her daughter's disappearance. Various people have claimed they would reveal Carla's whereabouts if a monetary amount was paid. Carla's sister stated she's been warned that she could be killed if she keeps searching for Carla; she's persisted in the search anyway.At the time of her disappearance, Carla was about to start seventh grade and was looking forward to it. She was close to her older sister, who by then had moved out of the family home, and her sister doesn't believe she would have gone this long without contact. Their mother believes that she was sexually assaulted and murdered shortly after her disappearance.Several years after Carla's disappearance, she was declared legally dead. A suspect claimed he knew her fate, but then he recanted his story. Her case remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected in Carla's case. Updated 7 times since October 12, 2004.

        "circumstances": "Carla, circa 1980; Age-progression to age 55 (circa 2020) Carla was last seen at her family's residence at the Eastwood public housing project on Airport Highway in Birmingham, Alabama during the evening hours of August 12, 1980. She and her mother were watching television, and then her mother went to bed.Her mother awoke at approximately 4:30 a.m. on August 13 and discovered the doors to their apartment were wide open. Chairs had been pushed back from the living room table and a soft drink bottle had been overturned as well.Carla's new sandals were near the couch where she had placed them the night before, and her belt was lying on the ground outside the front door. All of her belongings, including money and her medication, had been left behind. There was no sign of her inside the residence. She has never been seen again.Carla had been allegedly abducted and raped by a group of men in July 1980, one month prior to the time she was last seen. The three-hour attack had taken place near Lake Purdy in Alabama. The men had arrived at Carla's family's residence the week before she disappeared, but they were not permitted inside.It is not known if the previous attack is related to Carla's disappearance. No official report about the incident was filed at the time and the police didn't learn about it until eighteen years after Carla went missing. Authorities have continued to search for Carla since 1980.Throughout the years, her mother has been the victim of many individuals attempting to cash in on her daughter's disappearance. Various people have claimed they would reveal Carla's whereabouts if a monetary amount was paid. Carla's sister stated she's been warned that she could be killed if she keeps searching for Carla; she's persisted in the search anyway.At the time of her disappearance, Carla was about to start seventh grade and was looking forward to it. She was close to her older sister, who by then had moved out of the family home, and her sister doesn't believe she would have gone this long without contact. Their mother believes that she was sexually assaulted and murdered shortly after her disappearance.Several years after Carla's disappearance, she was declared legally dead. A suspect claimed he knew her fate, but then he recanted his story. Her case remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected in Carla's case. Updated 7 times since October 12, 2004.

They resided in a log cabin on a forty-acre property. The driveway leading up to the residence has two locked gates and as a result, the cabin can only be reached on foot.The day she went missing, Kimberly went to her job at Cloverdale Manor Nursing Home in Scottsboro, Alabama to pick up some papers. She called a friend on the way back home to Section, Alabama, but they were unable to talk because the connection was bad. Kimberly promised to call her friend back in five minutes. She never did.Kimberly's coworkers reported her disappearance on June 28, a week after she was last seen. Authorities interviewed her husband, Barry Van Whitton, who is Haleigh's stepfather. Barry stated Kimberly and Haleigh left their residence in a White Ford van or truck with Alabama license plates shortly after Kimberly arrived home from work. He said he gave his wife $20,000 in cash, and he never saw them after that. He stated they may have gone to Montana. They have never been heard from again.Photographs of Barry are posted with this case summary. He had been married to Kimberly for eight years prior to her disappearance. He has a criminal record; he was convicted on charges of receiving stolen property in 1988 and 1991. After authorities searched his property for evidence in his wife and stepdaughter's disappearance, they arrested Barry on weapons charges. Guns were found on his property, and he is not legally permitted to own them due to his criminal history.In September 2007, Barry pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of firearms. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. The typical sentence given for those charges is between 12 and 18 months, but the judge elected to sentence Barry to the maximum term due to the danger she believed he posed to the community; she described him as the most dangerous defendant she had seen in her judicial career.The judge heard witnesses testify that Barry bragged about having murdered three people, discussed body disposal and removing trace evidence, and threatened to kill other individuals, including his mother-in-law and the judge who placed his eleven-year-old son in foster care after Kimberly and Haleigh's disappearances.Barry is considered a suspect in Kimberly and Haleigh's cases, although he has never confessed to harming them. Authorities stated they found blood in one of his pickup trucks and on a hatchet handle, but the source of the blood has not been revealed.Barry's first wife, Michelle Townsend Whitton, also disappeared in late 1997. At the time Barry said she, like Kimberly and Haleigh, had simply left; he said Michelle went out to get breakfast and never came back. A photo of Michelle is posted with this case summary. She was found beaten and stabbed to death and buried in a shallow grave in DeKalb County, Alabama six weeks later, in January 1998.Barry and Kimberly met through a personals ad Barry placed in a magazine. They got married about a year after Michelle's death, after only four to six months of dating. It's unclear whether she knew his previous wife had been murdered or that he was considered a suspect.While in jail on the gun charges, Barry allegedly told a cellmate he did not kill Michelle, but he knew who did and he had killed that person. In December 2014, a little less than a year before he was supposed to be released from federal prison, Barry was indicted for Michelle's murder. He was found guilty in September 2015 and sentenced to life in prison.It's uncharacteristic of Kimberly and Haleigh to leave for an extended period without telling anyone. Kimberly had worked at the nursing home for seven years prior to her disappearance, and the only time she missed work was to take Haleigh on a school trip. Kimberly and Barry weren't having any known problems in their marriage in 2007, and Kimberly hadn't told anyone her husband was mistreating her. Barry hasn't faced any charges relating to their disappearances.Kimberly and her daughter may have traveled to Montana after they went missing, but investigators suspect foul play was involved in their cases. Haleigh was a fifth-grade student at Macedonia School at the time she went missing. Her disappearance and her mother's remain unsolved. Updated 8 times since October 12, 2004.

They lived in the 100 block of 59th Street in Fairfield, Alabama. The DHR was aware of two children living in the home at the time, a ten-year-old and a twelve-year-old; they didn't know about Jason or his nine-year-old sibling. Neither of them had ever been enrolled in school or been to a doctor recently. Based on conditions at the home, police issued arrest warrants for Wright and Jason Sr. charging them with aiding the dependency of minors. They tried to arrest the couple in October, but the family had moved out of the house. Photographs of Wright and Jason Sr. are posted with this case summary. On January 23, 2015, Wright was found unconscious at the 59th Street residence and taken to the hospital. Three days later, their other children were found with relatives in Mulga, Alabama and placed in DHR custody. Wright briefly regained consciousness and asked asked authorities about Jason. She said she had last seen him at their home, but was unable to say when. It was only then that authorities learned of Jason's existence. A search of the 59th Street home turned up no sign of him, and Jason Sr. has refused to provide any information as to his whereabouts.",

The DHR was aware of two children living in the home at the time, a ten-year-old and a twelve-year-old; they didn't know about Jason or his nine-year-old sibling. Neither of them had ever been enrolled in school or been to a doctor recently. Based on conditions at the home, police issued arrest warrants for Wright and Jason Sr. charging them with aiding the dependency of minors. They tried to arrest the couple in October, but the family had moved out of the house. Photographs of Wright and Jason Sr. are posted with this case summary. On January 23, 2015, Wright was found unconscious at the 59th Street residence and taken to the hospital. Three days later, their other children were found with relatives in Mulga, Alabama and placed in DHR custody. Wright briefly regained consciousness and asked asked authorities about Jason. She said she had last seen him at their home, but was unable to say when. It was only then that authorities learned of Jason's existence. A search of the 59th Street home turned up no sign of him, and Jason Sr. has refused to provide any information as to his whereabouts."

A photo of Haywood is posted with this case summary. He had dated Kersh, and authorities stated he'd been a person of interest from the onset of the investigation.

Kersh arrived soon after, and the witness heard a cry and a crash. Haywood drove a black SUV.In the summer of 2011, the case against Haywood was dropped because a judge ruled the prosecution hadn't given him his constitutional right to a speedy trial and because two pieces of evidence hadn't been tested for DNA.

Authorities stated they would refile the murder charges against him if more evidence resurfaced.Kersh was born in Russia and spent the first years of her life in an orphanage.

She has never been heard from again. Her van was discovered abandoned behind the AniMall, a pet store she owned in the 8100 block of Vaughn Road, at 9:00 a.m. on April 2, the day after her disappearance. There was no sign of Judie at the scene.Judie's husband, Albert Leonard Wilding, stated Judie had simply left him without saying where she was going. Their marriage was troubled; Judie's employees at the pet store witnessed the couple arguing, and they were sleeping in separate rooms.Albert stated Judie took some of her belongings, including family photos, credit cards, her driver's license and her wedding rings. However, police found Judie's driver's license and credit cards in her bedroom, and they later found her engagement and wedding rings in the bank safe deposit box which Albert opened after Judie's disappeared.In August 2008, eight and a half years after Judie's disappearance, Albert was charged with her murder. Photographs of him are posted with this case summary. Authorities believe he killed his wife for financial gain. Judie's pet store was failing financially and she had told him she planned to divorce him. They had been married for about 20 years by the time she vanished.Albert collected $815,000 from four life insurance policies on Judie in 2004, after he had her declared legally dead. He paid approximately $30,000 in premiums on the policies after she went missing, all the while maintaining that he had no idea where she was. If Judie had still been alive, she could have canceled the policies or cashed them in herself at any time.This wasn't the first time Albert had faced homicide charges. In 1970, he confessed to the murder of his mother-in-law in Kentucky. He had beaten, choked and stabbed her to death in her home. Authorities alleged the motive was to get her life insurance money. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter, but the state governor commuted his sentence and Albert was released after serving only one year.In February 2011, only minutes before his trial was scheduled to begin, Albert pleaded guilty to manslaughter in Judie's death. He stated he came home and found her in her bedroom packing to leave him, they began to argue, the argument turned physical, a gun was produced, and it went off accidentally, killing Judie. He said he kept Judie's body in the bathroom for a day, then attempted to burn it and disposed of what was left in various locations in and near Lake Martin.He was sentenced to five years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release. If convicted of the original capital murder charge, he could have gotten a sentence of life in prison without parole. He was scheduled to be released in mid-2013, but died in prison in March 2012.Foul play is suspected in Judie's case due to the circumstances involved. Updated 6 times since October 12, 2004.

She was reported missing by her sister on May 20, over two months after her disappearance. By this point the sisters had not spoken for four months, something which wasn't unusual, as Bierebach was often out of touch with her family.One of her last posts on social media read, \"3,2,1 blast off to the moon.\" Investigators believe she may have had someone pick her up so she could buy heroin. One theory is that she died of a drug overdose and whoever she was with disposed of her body to avoid facing criminal charges. She had been clean and sober for some time, but relapsed after her daughter's death from cancer several months before her disappearance, and planned to enter a long-term substance abuse treatment facility.Bierbach left behind a young son. Because she has outstanding warrants for her arrest, it's possible she's simply hiding from the law. She has ties to Jasper, Cordova and Attalla in Alabama, and has previously lived in southern California, Wichita Falls, Texas and Cape May, New Jersey. Few details are available in her case.

        "circumstances": "Bieberbach, circa 2018; Bieberbach's tattoos Bieberbach was last seen in the 1500 block of Empire Road in Empire, Alabama on March 6, 2018. She has never been heard from again. She was reported missing by her sister on May 20, over two months after her disappearance. By this point the sisters had not spoken for four months, something which wasn't unusual, as Bierebach was often out of touch with her family.One of her last posts on social media read, \"3,2,1 blast off to the moon.\" Investigators believe she may have had someone pick her up so she could buy heroin. One theory is that she died of a drug overdose and whoever she was with disposed of her body to avoid facing criminal charges. She had been clean and sober for some time, but relapsed after her daughter's death from cancer several months before her disappearance, and planned to enter a long-term substance abuse treatment facility.Bierbach left behind a young son. Because she has outstanding warrants for her arrest, it's possible she's simply hiding from the law. She has ties to Jasper, Cordova and Attalla in Alabama, and has previously lived in southern California, Wichita Falls, Texas and Cape May, New Jersey. Few details are available in her case. Updated 3 times since October 12, 2004. Last updated June 2, 2020; details of disappearance updated."

Her brother and sister-in-law in North Carolina reported her missing on January 21, 2009. Due to her drug problem, Adkins didn't have custody of her two daughters, but she did keep in touch with them. She spoke to her family on the phone on a weekly basis and saw her relatives at least once a month. Her loved ones stated she had a pattern of living with family members for a few months as she tried to get clean, then eventually moving in with a boyfriend. Shortly before her disappearance, Adkins wrote letters to her daughters talking about her life. She wrote that she was trying to find a new job, and talked about how her new housemate was treating her. She said had plans for a future with the man, and wanted to cook Thanksgiving Dinner for him and move into an apartment with him. When authorities spoke to Adkins's boyfriend, he said she'd moved out of their apartment and he thought she was in Houston, Texas with a man she was talking to over Facebook. Police spoke to the man in Houston, but he said he hadn't seen Adkins in years. Adkins has a warrant out for her arrest, issued in January 2009. She pleaded guilty to theft and drug possession in 2008 and was given a conditional suspended sentence, and is wanted for failing to comply with the terms. One of her children believes she may have died of a drug overdose, and foul play is also a possibility in her case. Her disappearance remains unsolved. Updated 3 times since October 12, 2004.

        "circumstances": "Adkins, circa 2008; Tattoo on Adkins's chest Adkins was last seen in Leeds, Alabama on November 13, 2008. She lived with a man on Highway 41. She has never been heard from again. Her brother and sister-in-law in North Carolina reported her missing on January 21, 2009. Due to her drug problem, Adkins didn't have custody of her two daughters, but she did keep in touch with them. She spoke to her family on the phone on a weekly basis and saw her relatives at least once a month. Her loved ones stated she had a pattern of living with family members for a few months as she tried to get clean, then eventually moving in with a boyfriend. Shortly before her disappearance, Adkins wrote letters to her daughters talking about her life. She wrote that she was trying to find a new job, and talked about how her new housemate was treating her. She said had plans for a future with the man, and wanted to cook Thanksgiving Dinner for him and move into an apartment with him. When authorities spoke to Adkins's boyfriend, he said she'd moved out of their apartment and he thought she was in Houston, Texas with a man she was talking to over Facebook. Police spoke to the man in Houston, but he said he hadn't seen Adkins in years. Adkins has a warrant out for her arrest, issued in January 2009. She pleaded guilty to theft and drug possession in 2008 and was given a conditional suspended sentence, and is wanted for failing to comply with the terms. One of her children believes she may have died of a drug overdose, and foul play is also a possibility in her case. Her disappearance remains unsolved. Updated 3 times since October 12, 2004. Last updated November 11, 2018; five pictures added, distinguishing characteristics, medical conditions and details of disappearance updated."

They resided in a log cabin on a forty-acre property. The driveway leading up to the residence has two locked gates and as a result, the cabin can only be reached on foot.The day she went missing, Kimberly went to her job at Cloverdale Manor Nursing Home in Scottsboro, Alabama to pick up some papers. She called a friend on the way back home to Section, Alabama, but they were unable to talk because the connection was bad. Kimberly promised to call her friend back in five minutes. She never did.Kimberly's coworkers reported her disappearance on June 28, a week after she was last seen. Authorities interviewed her husband, Barry Van Whitton, who is Haleigh's stepfather. Barry stated Kimberly and Haleigh left their residence in a White Ford van or truck with Alabama license plates shortly after Kimberly arrived home from work. He said he gave his wife $20,000 in cash, and he never saw them after that. He stated they may have gone to Montana. They have never been heard from again.Photographs of Barry are posted with this case summary. He had been married to Kimberly for eight years prior to her disappearance. He has a criminal record; he was convicted on charges of receiving stolen property in 1988 and 1991. After authorities searched his property for evidence in his wife and stepdaughter's disappearance, they arrested Barry on weapons charges. Guns were found on his property, and he is not legally permitted to own them due to his criminal history.In September 2007, Barry pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of firearms. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. The typical sentence given for those charges is between 12 and 18 months, but the judge elected to sentence Barry to the maximum term due to the danger she believed he posed to the community; she described him as the most dangerous defendant she had seen in her judicial career.The judge heard witnesses testify that Barry bragged about having murdered three people, discussed body disposal and removing trace evidence, and threatened to kill other individuals, including his mother-in-law and the judge who placed his eleven-year-old son in foster care after Kimberly and Haleigh's disappearances.Barry is considered a suspect in Kimberly and Haleigh's cases, although he has never confessed to harming them. Authorities stated they found blood in one of his pickup trucks and on a hatchet handle, but the source of the blood has not been revealed.Barry's first wife, Michelle Townsend Whitton, also disappeared in late 1997. At the time Barry said she, like Kimberly and Haleigh, had simply left; he said Michelle went out to get breakfast and never came back. A photo of Michelle is posted with this case summary. She was found beaten and stabbed to death and buried in a shallow grave in DeKalb County, Alabama six weeks later, in January 1998.Barry and Kimberly met through a personals ad Barry placed in a magazine. They got married about a year after Michelle's death, after only four to six months of dating. It's unclear whether she knew his previous wife had been murdered or that he was considered a suspect.While in jail on the gun charges, Barry allegedly told a cellmate he did not kill Michelle, but he knew who did and he had killed that person. In December 2014, a little less than a year before he was supposed to be released from federal prison, Barry was indicted for Michelle's murder. He was found guilty in September 2015 and sentenced to life in prison.It's uncharacteristic of Kimberly and Haleigh to leave for an extended period without telling anyone. Kimberly had worked at the nursing home for seven years prior to her disappearance, and the only time she missed work was to take Haleigh on a school trip. Kimberly and Barry weren't having any known problems in their marriage in 2007, and Kimberly hadn't told anyone her husband was mistreating her.

She visited the Spring Villa Grocery between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m. and got gasoline for her car, a 1972 Ford Galaxie. Dorsey told the gas station attendant that a relative had called her and she was going to pick the person up.One of Dorsey's neighbors reported seeing her turn into her driveway at 6:00 p.m. She has not been seen since. She was reported missing after she failed to arrive at church the next day; she was a Sunday School teacher and pianist and it was uncharacteristic of her to miss services.When authorities went to Dorsey's home on Route 1 in Opelika, they found the front door open and a side door unlocked. Laundry was hanging on the outside clothesline, Dorsey's Bible and Sunday School teaching materials were laid out on the table, and her bed did not appear to have been slept in.Her three dogs were found \"cowering\" in the bathroom, which is unusual; the animals would typically try to defend the property if someone came in while Dorsey was there.Dorsey's car was found in downtown Opelika near the First Baptist Church after her disappearance. The keys were the ignition and her eyeglasses and purse were on the front seat. Nothing appeared to be missing from the purse and it contained $11 in cash. Investigators stated it appeared that the car had been left by someone who was running an errand and intended to return within a short time.Curiously, the vehicle was parked in front of the first house Dorsey had lived in with her late husband. The door of the house was open, but authorities found no indications that Dorsey had been there recently.There have been no withdrawals from Dorsey's account since she disappeared. Police initially believed she left of her own accord, but her family suspected foul play from the beginning, as she was close to her relatives and it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning.Dorsey is a graduate of Randolph-Macon Women's College in Ashland, Virginia. She taught French and mathematics until her marriage in 1928. Her husband died in 1965. After his death she worked for the First National Bank in Opelika; she retired shortly before her disappearance. Dorsey is described as a strong, independent woman. Her case remains unsolved.

She left her boyfriend's house sometime between 11:00 and 11:45 p.m. to return to her father's residence, which was about a five-minute drive away, and her car pulled into the driveway at around midnight.She has never been seen again, and none of her shoes disappeared with her. She vanished four days before she was due to start her senior year of high school. She planned to attend the University of South Alabama and major in physical therapy.Kemberly's parents reported her as a missing person at 9:00 a.m. on August 17, two days after she was last seen. There was evidence of a struggle inside her bedroom and it's possible that she was been taken against her will.Foul play is suspected by both the police and Kemberly's family. Her boyfriend and all her family members have been ruled out as suspects. Her personal belongings were left behind at the home, including her eyeglasses, her contacts, jewelry, and money.Nine months after Kemberly's disappearance, on her eighteenth birthday, investigators searched a rural Walton County lake. They were acting on two tips that her body had been dumped there. The search lasted three days and turned up no clues relating to Kemberly's case.In 2001, a non-profit group in Texas searched Baptism Hole with cadaver dogs and got several hits. They dug up an engine block with a rope tied to it, but had to leave the site before they could excavate it completely. The next day the FBI brought in its own dogs and the animals gave no indication of smelling human remains, so there were no more searches conducted in that area.In September 2006, investigators searched a sinkhole near Ponce de Leon, Florida for Kemberly's remains after receiving an anonymous tip directing them to that location. The search turned up no evidence and Kemberly's case remains unsolved. Updated 6 times since October 12, 2004. Last updated February 23, 2019; picture added.",
